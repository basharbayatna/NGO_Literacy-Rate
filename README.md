## Data Cleaning

- **Removed duplicates** to ensure no repeated records.  
- **Handled missing values**:  
  - Missing regions were labeled as `MISSING`.  
  - Missing literacy rates were set to `-1`.  
- **Fixed typos** and inconsistencies in `Year` and `Gender` columns.  
- **Converted data types**: `Year` to integer and `Literacy rate` to float.  
- **Final check** confirmed no duplicates, missing values, or inconsistencies remain.

## Data Exploration

### Univariate Analysis

**Region Counts**  
- Latin America and the Caribbean has the highest number of records.  
- Sub-Saharan Africa follows.  
- Oceania and the MISSING category have the fewest records.  

**Year Distribution**  
- Data is unevenly distributed across years.  
- Peaks observed in 2011 and 2018.

---

### Multivariate Analysis

**Literacy Rate by Region**  
- Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest literacy rate.  
- Europe and Northern America has the highest.

**Literacy Rate by Gender**  
- Both genders show high literacy rates overall.  
- Females have a slightly lower median and wider spread than males.  
- Outliers exist in both genders.

**Literacy Rate by Age and Gender**  
- Males consistently have higher literacy rates than females across all age groups.  
- Literacy peaks in the 15â€“24 age group.  
- Significant drop observed in the 65+ age group.
